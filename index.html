                            I cannot stress enough how beautiful it feels to code in Python because of its neat flawless syntax. There are no braces for you to keep on continually balancing, whitespaces and tabs automatically do it for you (if you are using a Python editor like Idle, just like Eclipse automatically puts braces in Java). There are no semicolons to remember, no type safety to constantly bug you (although type safety does introduce a rigor useful while debugging). If someone is used to coding in Javascript, he will appreciate how much time can be saved when you don't need to worry about semicolons!

                        <li>Awesome Libraries</li>
                        <p>
                            Whatever project you are doing, whatever module you need, be it on image processing, or quick vector arithmetic, or natural language processing, or web scraping, virtually anything, and Python has all the libraries you need. These libraries come with excellent documentation, and much more popular, leading to much more visibility in coding forums like StackOverflow, so that you will find it painless to use. Nobody can appreciate this more than me, learning GWT was a sorry pain.

                        <li>Nice OOP Support</li>
                        <p>
                            Among the scripting languages, Python has perhaps the closest to ideal Object oriented programming support, next only to PHP. It doesn't support encapsulation like PHP, that might be a drawback, but other than that, it is pretty neat and standardized. People who have had a nightmarish experience while doing OOP in Perl, or a clumsy experience while doing so in Javascript in a part-prototypal-part-classical way, they will just love it.
                        </p>
                        <li>Awesome Shortcuts</li>
                        <p>
                            Closures, first class functions just like Javascript, list comprehensions, lambda functions, array reduction, etc. Python is absolutely fun to code!

                        In this article I'm going to tell you about a game called Rimworld. It was created by an indie developer Tynan Sylvester. Rimworld is a base building game in which the goal is to build a base and defend against all kinds of natural and man-made(or in the game's case storyteller made) calamities.
                        In Rimworld, there are these storytellers that dictate the way your colony is going to end up.
                        The game has so much depth to it, I cannot discuss it in such a few words.
